# PyCity Schools Analysis

* As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%). Also note that charter schools to tend to be smaller in size so they make up most of the smaller and medium sized schools. There was one large charter school, and it did score very well, which would lead you to think that it is more about the type of school rather than the size, as other large schools performed poorly. This is a small sample size to go from but very insightful.

* In general, higher school budgets did not result in better test scores. In fact, schools that spent more tended to perform worse than schools that spent less on a per student basis. This could show reckless spending, or no strategy in an organization's spending, showing recklesness.


* Overall, charter schools outperformed public district schools in all areas besides reading. This could be due to charter schools having smaller population sizes, allowing for more student care, or it could be a factor of charter schools having different practices, as they have less goverment regulation in the way.
